# Who is me?
I'm some random girl online with a love for software development and Lemon Coca Cola. I got into code because I played Halo 3 as a kid; I saw videos of people getting outside of level boundaries and it made me interested in how I could use the tools the game gave me to create unintended scenarios. That then progressed into me playing Halo Custom Edition and learning the tools for that. And I guess that's why I am here. Wy username is lame but most people have a lame name. I just needed something. There's a girl in Utena called Anthy, roses are in the show a loot. Combine those together and it sounds like Ampharos and I like that Pokemon.
# Coding
I like C development. It's a very simple but powerful language. Library support is not good so I use rust to cover it often. The garbage collection in Rust is not enjoyable. I do some C# out of the fact that most applications are developed in that now. And despite my hate for it I will do C++. I like to write tools for video games. Despite that I don't want to be a video game dev. I'm happy to write a lot of thing. I just enjoy code.
